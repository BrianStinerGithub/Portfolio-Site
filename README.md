This is a development of a static website to link to the source code of my projects and to share my knowledge.

Built with [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and  [jinja2](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/)
DevOps simply runs frozen_flask with github actions and deploys to github pages.
Its a JAMtastic site that has a mini-game for firstcomers, a simple desctiption of me and links to my previous work, documents, and a contact page.
