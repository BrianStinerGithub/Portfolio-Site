This is a development of a static website to link to the source code of my projects and to share my knowledge.

Built with [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and  [jinja2](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/)
DevOps simply runs frozen_flask with github actions.
Following JAMstack principles, the website is hosted with [fleek] on [ICP](https://fleek.co/internet-computer-hosting/)
